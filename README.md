# algo_study_helper

A project intended to make studying algorithms easier / more stream lined.

This project has a directory of existing problems, which are used to create
"scratch" files for you to practice on.

## Workflow

python3 go_study.py

^^ Generate scratch.py and test_scratch.py.  scratch.py will include a prompt
for the problem and a function called main.  Write your solution in main,
then run test suit:

python3 test_scratch.py


Very simple, but I have found this to be very helpful.
